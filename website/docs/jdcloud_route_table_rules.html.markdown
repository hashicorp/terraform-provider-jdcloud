# jdcloud\_route\_table\_rules

### Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jdcloud_route_table_rules" "rule-example" {
  route_table_id = "rtb-example"
  rule_specs = [

    {
      next_hop_type  = "internet"
      next_hop_id    = "internet"
      address_prefix = "10.0.0.0/16"
    },

    {
      next_hop_type  = "instance"
      next_hop_id    = "i-example"
      address_prefix = "10.0.2.0/16"
  }]

}
```
